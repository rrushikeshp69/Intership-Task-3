# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

![Power BI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Power%20BI-F2C811?style=for-the-badge&logo=powerbi&logoColor=black)

An interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing road accident data to uncover patterns, identify hotspots, and gain insights into the key factors contributing to accidents.

## üìÇ Project Description

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive and interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI to visualize and analyze road accident data. The primary goal is to provide a clear and insightful overview of accident statistics, enabling users to identify trends and make data-driven decisions for improving road safety. The dashboard centralizes various key performance indicators (KPIs) and provides multiple filters for a granular analysis of the data.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Executive Summary Dashboard:** A high-level overview with key metrics such as total accidents, casualties, and a breakdown by severity.
- **Interactive Filtering:** Slicers and filters for year, road surface conditions, weather conditions, vehicle type, and more.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Visualizations to analyze accident trends by time of day, day of the week, and month.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** (If map data is included) A map visual to identify accident hotspots and high-risk locations.
- **Causal Analysis:** Charts that break down accidents by contributing factors like weather, road conditions, and light conditions.
- **Vehicle & Casualty Insights:** Detailed analysis of accident involvement by vehicle type and demographic data of casualties.

## üíæ Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis includes information on road accidents, covering various attributes such as:
- Accident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
- Date and Time
- Location
- Road and Weather Conditions
- Vehicle Types
- Casualty Information (Age, Gender, Severity)

*(Note: Describe the source of your data here, e.g., "Data sourced from the UK Department for Transport.")*

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Microsoft Power BI:** Used for data modeling, creating DAX measures, and designing the interactive dashboard.
- **Power Query:** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation (ETL).
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating custom calculations and key performance indicators.

## üöÄ How to Use

To view and interact with this report:

1.  **Download** the `Road_Accident_Analysis.pbix` file from this repository.
2.  **Open** the file using [**Microsoft Power BI Desktop**](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).
3.  **Explore** the dashboard by clicking on different visuals and using the provided slicers to filter the data.

## üí° Key Insights (Example)

This dashboard provides several key insights into road accidents, including:

- **Peak Accident Times:** The majority of accidents occur during the evening rush hour, specifically between 4 PM and 7 PM.
- **High-Risk Days:** Weekends, particularly Saturdays, show a higher number of fatal accidents compared to weekdays.
- **Primary Contributing Factor:** Wet road conditions are a significant factor, contributing to over 30% of all serious accidents.
- **Vehicle Involvement:** Motorcycles are disproportionately involved in fatal accidents relative to their number on the road.

*(Replace the above with the actual insights derived from your analysis.)*
